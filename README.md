## ✨ Key Features

* **Versatile Game Modes:** Play Solo (1 Player) or compete/co-op in the chaotic 2 Player Mode.
* **Power-up System:**
    * 🧲 **Magnet:** Automatically attracts fruits to your bucket.
    * ❄️ **Freeze:** Slows down time and falling objects.
    * 🛡️ **Shield:** Protects you from bombs for a short duration.
    * ☠️ **Poison:** Confuses the opponent (or yourself) by inverting controls.
    * 🧨 **TNT:** Explodes and clears all falling items on the screen.
* **Seasonal Environment Mechanics:** Gameplay changes every level cycle:
    * 🌸 **Spring:** Higher chance of healing items.
    * ☀️ **Summer:** Fruits fall 30% faster due to the heat.
    * 🍂 **Autumn:** Strong winds cause fruits to drift sideways (Sine wave motion).
    * ❄️ **Winter:** Icy floors create inertia/sliding physics for movement.
* **Boss Fight 🦍:** Every 4 Levels, the Gorilla Boss appears to rain down bombs. The difficulty scales the longer you survive!
* **Visual "Juice":** Includes Screen Shake impacts and Particle effects for a satisfying experience.

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
| Action | Player 1 (P1) | Player 2 (P2) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Move** | Arrow Keys (⬅️ ➡️) | WASD Keys (A - D) |
| **Character** | Red Bucket 🔴 | Blue Bucket 🔵 |

### Rules
1.  Catch fruits to gain points and level up.
2.  Avoid **Bombs** 💣. Catching a bomb costs 1 Life (unless you have a Shield).
3.  **2-Player Mode:** If **ANY** player runs out of lives, it is **GAME OVER** immediately. The surviving player is declared the winner!
